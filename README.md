#### Problem Statement

In this assignment, you will build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 

Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for <b>75% of skin cancer deaths</b>. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the <b>International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)</b>. All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.


The data set contains the following diseases:

    1. Actinic keratosis
    2. Basal cell carcinoma
    3. Dermatofibroma
    4. Melanoma
    5. Nevus
    6. Pigmented benign keratosis
    7. Seborrheic keratosis
    8. Squamous cell carcinoma
    9. Vascular lesion
    
Below are the step to create model.

     Step 1: Data Reading/Data Understanding
     Step 2: Dataset Creation
     Step 3: Dataset visualisation
     Step 4: Model Building & training
     Step 5: Chose an appropriate data augmentation strategy to resolve underfitting/overfitting 
     Step 6: Model Building & training on the augmented data
     Step 7: Class distribution
     Step 8: Handling class imbalances
     Step 9: Model Building & training on the rectified class imbalance data
